git clone https://github.com/dikjain/crypto-weather-nexus.git
cd crypto-weather-nexus
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìê Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Chose Zustand over Redux for its simplicity and built-in async support
- Implemented a centralized store with separate concerns for weather, crypto, and news data
- Used localStorage for persisting user preferences

### Real-Time Updates
- WebSocket connection for live cryptocurrency prices
- Periodic API polling (60s intervals) for weather and news updates
- Optimistic UI updates with error handling

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for off-screen content
- Debounced API calls and WebSocket reconnection logic

### UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent animation patterns using Framer Motion
- Error boundaries and fallback UI components
- Toast notifications for important updates

## üéØ Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Rate Limits
- Implemented caching layer for API responses
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Used stale-while-revalidate pattern for data freshness

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Data Management
- Created WebSocket connection manager with automatic reconnection
- Implemented data normalization for consistent state updates
- Added error handling for connection failures

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
- Implemented component code-splitting
- Optimized re-renders using React.memo and useMemo
- Added loading states and skeleton screens

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive across all device sizes:
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Input sanitization for user-provided data
- Security headers configured in Next.js

## üß™ Testing

To run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

## üì¶ Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel with the following configuration:
- Automatic deployments on main branch updates
- Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- Edge caching enabled for static assets
